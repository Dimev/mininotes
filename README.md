# MiniNotes
A tiny terminal and gui notetaking app

Mainly serves as an example on how to make text editing work on both terminal and gui, in a decent way.

Feel free to use this as reference for whatever you want

Current goals:
 - grapheme navigation - V
 - line numbers - ~ no relative yet
 - status bar - V
 - loading and saving - ~ saving new files doesn't always create the right path
 - mouse to cursor position - ~ doesn't properly alighn with the true UI layout.
 - undo/redo - ~ need to fix bugs and make it detect manual undo/redo
 - selection - V
 - copy/pase
 - pageup/pagedown scroll
 - skip words navigation
 - clean up code
 
Maybe goals:
 - gui renderer (first steps are there, but font rendering is pain)
